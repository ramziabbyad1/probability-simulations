'''
Two players are at deuce in a tennis match â€” player 1 has 60 percent of winning the point and player 2 has 40 percent chance. What are the odds of player 1 winning?

First, how does deuce work?  after winning a deuce, the second player has a chance to reenter deuce, otherwise the point goes to the player that wins 2 in a row.

There is a state diagram to manage this interaction.  But it is difficult to draw out here.

X = proabibiity of p1 winning deuce

=> X = (.6)(.6) + 2*(.6)(.4)X
=> X = .6923
